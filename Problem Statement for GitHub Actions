GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline Flask App

Objective:
Implement a CI/CD workflow using GitHub Actions for a Python application.

Requirements:
1. Setup:
   - Use a provided Python application repository on GitHub (provide a link to a sample Python application repository).
   - Ensure the repository has a main branch and a staging branch.
2. GitHub Actions Workflow:
   - Create a .github/workflows directory in your repository.
   - Inside the directory, create a YAML file to define the workflow.
3. Workflow Steps:
     - Define a workflow that performs the following jobs:
     - Install Dependencies: Install all necessary dependencies for the Python application using pip.
     - Run Tests: Execute the test suite using a framework like pytest.
     - Build: If tests pass, prepare the application for deployment.
     - Deploy to Staging: Deploy the application to a staging environment when changes are pushed to the staging branch.
     - Deploy to Production: Deploy the application to production when a release is tagged.
4. Environment Secrets:
   - Use GitHub Secrets to store sensitive information required for deployments (e.g., deployment keys, API tokens).
